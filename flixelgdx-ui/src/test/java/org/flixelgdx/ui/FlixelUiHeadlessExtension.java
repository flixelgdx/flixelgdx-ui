/**
 * Installs the minimal framework state a unit test needs, without any GPU or windowing backend.
 *
 * <p>The framework's systems are normally brought up by a platform launcher. Tests do not have
 * one, so this extension fills the one gap that pure logic tests still hit: file access. It
 * installs the real java.io {@link FlixelJvmFiles} backend on {@code Flixel.files} so anything
 * that reads or writes files works against a real temp directory instead of the silent no-op
 * default. Everything else the framework exposes already defaults to a safe no-op, so no
 * rendering, audio, or input backend is required.
